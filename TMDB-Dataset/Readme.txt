In this project, I will investigate a dataset from the TMDB database. I will try to analyze it in a story-telling way  
and try to figure out some obvious questions about the success of a movie. we will look through the years at how the profit  
and budget have changed and also to see if a specific genre is preferred over others. we will get to know the most profitable director, actors/actresses, and production companies.  
they're all interesting facts to know, aren't they?  
  
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.  
questions to be addressed in this report are:  
1) What are the trends of Budget, Revenue, and Profit over time?  
2) is there a correlation between budget and vote/popularity?  
3) What are the top 3 genres that profit the most?  
4) What are the most genres produced?  
5) is there a specific genre that is more costly than others?  
6) what are the popularity and avg. voting for the top 10 actors, directors, and production companies?
